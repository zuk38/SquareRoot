            Vi har knyttet alle aktÃ¸rer til samme plattform slik at vi sammen
            kan gjÃ¸re det enklere Ã¥ velge grÃ¸nt.
            <br />
            <br />
            Vi baserer databasen vÃ¥r pÃ¥ forskningsbaserte resultater for Ã¥ finne
            de beste plantene for riktig sted. Dette knyttes til lovgivninger,
            miljÃ¸sertifiseringer og Ã¸konomiske insentiver, og sÃ¸rger dermed for
            at du velger et motstandsyktig, bÃ¦rekraftig og Ã¸konomisk
            grÃ¸ntomrÃ¥de. Vi samarbeider med planteskoler slik at forsyningen av
            planter holder tritt med etterspÃ¸rselen, slik at din bedrift mottar
            bestillingen i tide med de rette plantene.
            <br />

            Vi forstÃ¥r at slike prosesser kan innebÃ¦re endringer grunnet ulike

              Well designed urban green spaces are a powerful climate
